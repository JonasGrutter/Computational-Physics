# Computational-Physics

These projects were carried out in the context of my Computational Physics 1 and 2 classes during my second year at EPFL. The simulations were implemented in C++ and the data analysis was done in Matlab. Unfortunately, the code cannot be shared in public for the sake of the course ( in order not to give the answers to the following students).

I did these projects with my friend Chlo√© Mondon.
